#### SOFTWARE TO BE USED THROUGHOUT THE COURSE
##### Wireshark
**FORENOTE:** This was based on the lab from last week but we did not have enough time in the lab room to go over it. *Unfortunately,* I was located in the side of the room but the prof did record it.

- This program automatically organises packets into colours based on present filters
	- THESE COLOURS CAN BE CHANGED
- By clicking into the row, the bottom left "terminal" gives information such as the MAC address, protocol type etc
	- it can also split the MAC address' into the source and the destination
- You can filter out the packets by filtering
	- for example, if you wanted the DNS packets then you would just type DNS in the filter search bar located just above the window showing all of the packets
	- *to close the filter* - press the **cross/x** on the right of the filter search bar
- *You **CAN** filter by time and date also*
- A three way handshake (TCP) is:
	- sending system sends a sync request (SYN)
	- receiving system receives this
	- receiving system sends a sync request + acknowledge signal (ACK + SYN)
	- sending system sends an acknowledge signal (ACK)
##### Cisco Packet Tracer 
**FORENOTE:** This was based on the lab from last week but we did not have enough time in the lab room to go over it. *Unfortunately,* I was located in the side of the room but the prof did record it.
